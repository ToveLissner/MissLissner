# Backend

This project represents the backend part of the MissLissner project, built using Node.js with Typescript and Express.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with backend development:

1. **Navigate to the `server` directory in the terminal:**

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. **Create a .env file in the server directory and add the following line to set the server port:**

   PORT={yourChoiceOfPortNumber}

3. **Install dependencies using Yarn:**

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

This will run the server in development mode. The server will be accessible at [http://localhost:{yourChoiceOfPortNumber}](http://localhost:{yourChoiceOfPortNumber}).

The server will automatically restart if you make edits.

## Additional Commands

In addition to `yarn start`, you can use the following commands:

- `yarn test`: Run tests in interactive mode.
- `yarn build`: Build the application for production in the `build` directory.
