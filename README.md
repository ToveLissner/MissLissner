# MissLissner Project

MissLissner is a full-stack project consisting of:

- `client`: Frontend built with React and TypeScript.
- `server`: Backend built with Node.js and Express.

## Getting Started

The following instructions will help you get started with both frontend and backend.

### Frontend (client)

Navigate to the `client` directory and follow the instructions in [client/README.md](client/README.md) to start and develop the frontend.

### Backend (server)

Navigate to the `server` directory and follow the instructions in [server/README.md](server/README.md) to start and develop the backend.

### API Testing with Postman

Explore and test the API endpoints using Postman. You can find the Postman collection [here](https://interstellar-resonance-84286.postman.co/workspace/New-Team-Workspace~bdb97639-0ef7-4efe-af60-a7b47cc06df9/collection/31971468-eb3ade6c-db6a-4589-ad32-b37f8662aafa?action=share&creator=31971468).

Feel free to use Postman to interact with the backend and test different API calls.
